# Beats-by-Dre-Qualitative-and-Quantitative-Insights

This is a remote internship at *Beats by Dre Electronics (Culver City, CA)* in collaboration with *Extern (formerly ParagonOne)*. It runs for 12 weeks starting from June 30th 2025 until September 19th 2025. Thank you to Michael Guerrero who was my program manager for both my externships.


The Qualitative & Quantitative Insights Externship consists of four (4) projects. Starting with an introduction to the Beats brand, its history and identity; we learned to approach the tasks with a good understanding of the legacy to help preserve it. Since the program is ongoing, I will update this page as new content becomes available.

## PROJECT 1/4
Included in this repository as a PDF named "ConsumerTypes" is the first project submission. I was asked to prepare a list of five (5) consumer groups based on age, career, interests and more. I took some creative liberty with the design.

#### DESIGN CHOICES
The example marketing campaigns sometimes include non-instrumental tech or gadgets outside of the Beats by Dre scope. They are either highlighted or crossed out with “pen”. They are only placeholders, not the intended product.

1. For **The Creative** I went with bold colors and shapes, creating the mosaic you see on pages 4-5. The scribbles highlight the products while also creating a “unique image” as this type of consumer requires attention to detail and branding.

2. **The Executive** is serious and monotone. I only used “pen” and was not exactly abundant in the color choice. This consumer knows what they like, they are straightforward and so is the design. The pattern at the bottom of pages 6-7 is inspired by argyle sweaters and corporate fashion.

3. **The Cool Kids**‘ design is extremely -and perhaps too- colorful. It is representative of a teenager expressing identity or seeking community. The products aimed at this consumer group are highly customizable, so the design is heavily influenced by the free-spirited nature of a teen.

4. When it comes to **The Peace and Quiet**, an important aspect for me to reflect was the minimalism to signal noise cancellation while including elements of transportation and schoolwork. This implies that the consumer is most likely a student or commuter using public spaces, often exposed to excessive noise. I created the flight-ticket-poster on page 11 and yes, the barcode works!

5. Lastly, **The Informed**. A slightly more tech-savvy consumer due to interest in the product or a dependence on it. The target audience could be an athlete or a musician. I stuck to the “unique” image for marketing to this consumer while incorporating elements of their interests in sports, music, and more.
